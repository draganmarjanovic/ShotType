# ShotType
An app that allows you to change your screenshot format.


## About
ShotType lets you select a format for saving screenshots. Once you select the format, any subsequent screenshots will be taken and saved in that format. The formats currently supported are:
+ .png
+ .jpg
+ .tiff
+ .psd
+ .pdf


## Installation
You may need to "Allow apps from anywhere". This allows apps that aren't from the app store to be installed and run on your Mac. To do this go into "Settings" > "Security and Privacy" and "Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere".


## Credits

Thanks to Daniel Kenafake for creating the app icon and providing design guidance.
